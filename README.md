# Be like LargeCoffeeNoCreme
So, you're either here because I sent you here because you asked me what my development environment is, or you stumbled upon this in the aether of the internet. Regardless, here is your final warning to not do this if you don't care about spending time to make things work. If you don't, just use a regular IDE like everyone else...no shame there! I learned to code in a standard setup, and I worked professionally for 5 years in a standard setup. If you are not prepared to deal with pain and suffering because you are literally just trying to get your syntax highlighting to work in your code editor, you will probably hate this setup :).

IF however, you are feeling like you want some more customization, or you want to improve your efficiency, or you just want to feel like a hardcore developer (who doesn't, lol)...I've gathered some resources here from my config setups for various tooling I use to write code, build apps, and tinker with OS stuff. 

For some reason, I find this stuff fun. If you do too, then welcome to the party!

## Code like me
Use nvim, then use these configuration files to get your setup to match.
```
erik_config.lua
keybindings.lua
````

## Tinker like me

### MacOS
- Terminal: iTerm2

### Linux
- Distro: Nobara (optimized for gaming, streaming, recording, and just general usability)
- Desktop Environment: GNOME
- Terminal: GNOME Terminal

### Terminal Multiplexer
Use tmux, thank me later. When you install tmux, you'll need to throw in this config file into your home directory, then install the tmux plugins using the documentation you can find online. I'll try to update this if needed. 
```
.tmux.conf
```

### HomeLab
This will probably get its own repo at some point. More to come here.
