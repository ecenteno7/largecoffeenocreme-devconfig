## Code like me
Use nvim, then use these configuration files to get your setup to match.
```
erik_config.lua
keybindings.lua
````

## Tinker like me

### MacOS
- Terminal: iTerm2

### Linux
- Distro: Nobara (optimized for gaming, streaming, recording, and just general usability)
- Desktop Environment: GNOME
- Terminal: GNOME Terminal

### Terminal Multiplexer
Use tmux, thank me later. When you install tmux, you'll need to throw in this config file into your home directory, then install the tmux plugins using the documentation you can find online. I'll try to update this if needed. 
```
.tmux.conf
```
